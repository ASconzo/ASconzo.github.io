						<h2>Welcome to my Website!</h2>
						<p><i>-- 11 November 2023</i></p>
						<hr>
						<p>Hi! My name is Alex Sconzo. I am a student attending Western Governor's Univerity's online program. 
							I am currently working my way towards earning my Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security and Information Assurance. 
							The purpose of this website is to document my growth in all related subjects of cyber security. 
							In addition to my online schooling, I am also working on several side projects. These all include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript!</strong><br>
								--In fact; this entre website was written from scratch using pure HTML and CSS. 
								I closely followed the tutorials published by <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3 Schools</a>
								and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">Mozilla</a>.
								Also of great help was the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">CSS Tricks' Flexbox tutorial</a>.
								This website makes heavy use of flexboxes to arrange its content. I could probably get away with using less of them but
								I think think its too early to refactor my entire format. I would rather focus on building out more content for the website.</li>
							<li><strong>Python programming!</strong><br>
								--Learning some programming I think will be essential to my professional development. 
								I have already taken a course in it as part of my school curriculum 
								but there is always more room to grow and more things to learn. 
								I undrstand that working with and reading other people's code is a major part of working in the 
								industry and that is something I have little experience with. I will eventually be putting up on 
								here pages specifically to show off any Python programming projects I am working on or have worked on. 
								Unfortunately my curriculum pretty much just taught the basics of it, i.e. the built in classes 
								and functions, how to create your own classes, and minimally touching on topics like File IO 
								and recursion. That means no experience collaborating or putting together a feature-complete project. 
								The class taught very little in respect to what real-world programmers will actually do in 
								their day-to-day. So I'd like to get some experience doing all this stuff.</li>
							<li><strong>Linux!</strong><br>
								---While traditionally I have always been a Windows users, 
								I have recently installed Kali Linux on a virtual machine and begun to play around with 
								learning Linux. Offensive Security has published a small textbook on learning how to use Kali and 
								I have been slowly working my way through it to get some experience. There is definitely a 
								learning curve especially in regards to learning how to navigate the Linux terminal. I recently 
								have been reading about different Linux distro's and one project I would like to take on is installing 
								a feature complete Arch-Linux distro. Arch-Linux is known for being a very hands-on DIY distro 
								that the community expects you to learn it yourself by reading the resources and documentation and 
								I think that going through that experience will be very valuable. This paragraph is getting long 
								so <s>I think I will make a</s> have made a <a href="linux02-01-2024.html">separate blog post</a> just about Linux after this.<br>
								</li>
							<li><strong>HacktheBox!</strong><br>
								--My curriculum thus far has mostly been learning about general IT conects and 
								learning more of a large overview of the cybersecuirty industry, it hasn't really gone 
								down into the specific nitty gritty of how to actually perform a hack. This is where 
								Hackthebox comes in. what good is installing Kali if I don't put myself into any situations where 
								I need to actually learn how to use any of the included tools?</li>
							<li><strong>Amazon Web Service!</strong><br>
								--At the time of this writing, this website is not hosted on any sort of service and 
								isn't connected to the internet at all. I wouldn't even call it a website, 
								it is more of just a few HTML documents linked together. I eventually want to learn how to use 
								AWS and to use it to host my website. I can buy an affordable domain-name and host the actual 
								web documents on AWS. This will be another massive learning experience as configuring cloud 
								services is a massive part of IT these days. </li>
							<li><strong>Other Things!</strong><br>
								--I don't know, I don't have anything specific to put in this section, 
								but if I think of anything that fits in, then it will go on here too. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Wow! That's a lot of stuff. Anyways, check back here to see anything else that I might add. 
							Thanks for reading, and see you next time!
