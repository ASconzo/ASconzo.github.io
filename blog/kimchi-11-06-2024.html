						<h2>Making Kimchi</h2>
						<p><i>-- 06 November 2024</i></p>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Sometime last month, I decided I wanted to get into fermenting foods. My partner and I have been trying to eat healthier for the past year or so. You know, getting more protein, getting more fiber, eating a wider variety of foods, cutting back on carbs and sugars, etc. I think we've been doing a great job at it and even discovered some new favorites, like seitan and lentils. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Fermented foods is something I've been eying for a while because A) I like them, and B) they're super good for your gut health. Like, really good. I read somewhere that a single mouthful of kimchi contains more probiotics than an entire bottle of probiotic supplements. Now, claims like that I always treat with a healthy amount of suspicion, but if I am honest it really doesn't matter to me if it's true or not. It's well known enough that fermented foods contain a ton of healthy probiotics so a claim like that is, for me, "close-enough" to being true that its not worth my time and energy to track down the exact validity of it. For now,that unverified statement will have the privilige of living on rent-free in my brain until fate decides to present a more compelling counterargument to me.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Get on with the kimchi!" says my one reader.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Okay fine, geeze," says I.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyways, so I went and looked at a few different recipes. I worked as a cook for 5 years and I cook recreationally as often as I am able, so a lot of the time I can look at a recipe, grok the idea, and go on my merry way and make a pretty good version of it, but Korean cooking and vegeatable fermentation are completely outside my wheel-house so I felt better following a recipe this time. The first one I looked at was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV5XpqFgvQ0">This video by Modern Pepper</a>. This was an excellent overview for the process of kimchi making. The host is personable, clearly has a long history of making kimchi with her family, and the video offers a huge variety of tips and tricks for making the best version of it.
						</p>
						<p>
							The idea is really pretty simple. First we take napa cabbage, salt it and let is sit for a while. This draws moisture out of the plant via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis">osmotic acitivity</a> and softens the fibers. According to the video, the thick bases of the cabbage leaves should be so soft that you can bend them 180 degrees around without snapping it. Letting it sit in salt will also work to kill off the surface-dwelling bad-bacterias that we don't want in our kimchi. While the kimchi is salting, we will prepare a paste made primarily out of Korean gochu-garu powder, a sort of pulverized Korean chili powder. This paste will also include a glue made from a thickened slurry of rice-flour and, and a few other miscellaneous ingredients. The cabbage then gets rinsed off several times to wash away the salt, then tossed with the paste and stuck into a jar or other vessel to ferment for a few days. According to Modern Pepper, families will make a whole years supply of the stuff all in one session, then they'll jar it up and pack it away for use throughout the year. It only takes a few days of fermenting on the countertop to develop a good flavor, and then you can keep it in the refrigerator pretty much indefinitely.
						</p>
						<p>
							The deal-breaker ingredients for me were the fish-sauce and salted shrimp which get blended into the paste. My girlfriend won't eat fish-paste or shrimp so we don't keep any in the house, and I'm not about to go buy a bottle of something just to use it on a single recipe. So I had to find some alternative vegan-kimchi recipes. I found a few: <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/chaesik-kimchi">the highly reccomended Maangchi offered a version</a>. Some other recipes I looked at were <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-vegan-kimchi/">this one by the Minimalist Baker</a> which just asked for vegetable broth instead of fish-sauce and shrimp, <a href="https://thekoreanvegan.com/the-best-easy-vegan-kimchi-recipe/">this one by the Korean Vegan</a>, which has a homemade vegetarian fish-sauce, and <a href="https://thevietvegan.com/vegan-kimchi/">this one by the Viet Vegan=</a>, which also called called for vegetarian fish-sauce.
						</p>
						<p>
							So after examining all these recipes what I ended up doing was just winging it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here's my ingredients list:
							<ul>
								<li>One napa cabbage -- <em>this guy was huge, even the smallest ones they had at the grocery were like 4 pounds!!</em></li>
								<li>One carrot, cut julienne style</li>
								<li>One daikon radish, cut julienne style</li>
								<li>One bunch of green onions, chopped</li>
								<li>One whole head of garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
								<li>One half of one whole sweet onion, roughly chopped</li>
								<li>Slurry made from 1 C water with 1/4 C wheat flower, heated on stove until thick,  (<em>traditionally, they use rice-flour, but I don't have any of that, and Modern Pepper says it's okay to sub it for white-flour in a pinch, but I don't have any of that either, so I used wheat-flour instead</em>)</li>
								<li>One honeycrisp apple, roughly chopped</li>
								<li>One tablespoon of pulverized dried Mexican chili peppers, (<em>I don't know what kind these were, we got a bag of them years ago at a Mexican grocery store in Tacoma WA and I have long forgotten the name. They are little and red and they pack a helluva punch. I used these instead of the gochu-garu because I already had them on hand and I detest buying packs and bottles of things just to use them in a single-recipe</em>)</li>
								<li>A few splashes of Worcestershire sauce (<em>This was to sub for fish-sauce. Yes, I know worcestershire has anchovies in it. No, I did not realize that when we bought the bottle. No, I am not going to throw it out</em>)</li>
								<li>A good splash of pineapple juice</li>
								<li>A good splash of vegetable broth, (<em>I use the Better than Bouillon concentrated stock</em>)</li>
								<li>a few shakes of Paprika</li>
							</ul>
						<p>
							Then I pretty muchfollowed the format as described above. I wish I took pictures of the process. I didn't plan on making a blog post about it until iterally this morning when I sat down to write something, so I only have images of the finished product.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Salting the Cabbage</strong>: This part was really interesting. First I chopped the cabbage up into bite-sized chunks, then tossed them into a huge glass mixing bowl, layering them lasagna-style with heavy sprinklings of kosher salt. Once it all was added, I gave it a thorough mixing and set the timer. After they sat for one hour, they still had retained their firm crispiness, but they were beginning to sweat. After two hours, they had significantly softened, and they had sweated out probably about a cup of water. After three hours, they were nice and soft, tasted nice and salty, and they passed the bend test I wrote about earlier.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Making the Paste</strong>: This part was fun too. In between hours 2 and 3 of the cabbage, I prepared the paste. I started by pulverizing my Mexican chilis. This fresh chili-powder kicked my butt. It was so spicy. Good-lord this stuff was spicy. I threw this, the onion, the garlic, the apple, the flour-slurry, and the liquid ingredients into a blender and cranked it up to medium until I had a homogenous paste. It wasen't red enough though, it was a kind of light-brown. So I shook in a bunhc of paprika, which gave it a nice smoky flavor and a beautiful red shade. Then I tossed that paste together with the julienned carrots, radish, and green onions. The paste had a great flavor, sweet and fruity but earthy and spicy too.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Putting it all together</strong>: I rinsed my cabbage a few times to get the salt off, and tossed it with my paste. I stuffed it all down into a half-gallon sized mason jar and it just barely fit. then I left it on the counter for about three days. I currently live in south Texas, and the highs this time of year are still in the low 90s, with high humidity, so this stuff fermented fast. Each day, once in the morning and once in the evening, I popped the lid to let it breathe, and a whole load of bubbles would rise to the top and the lid would pop from the internal pressure as soon as the seal was broke. Each day the flavor got a little bit stronger. After three days I called it done and stuck it in the refrigerator.
						</p>
						<p>
							So how was it? Honestly it was okay. I think the recipe could use some work. It's alright, and I've been eating a few spoonfuls every morning to seed my gut with my home-grown probiotics. I think its a little too spicy and the other flavors don't come through strong enough to combat the spice. I think the ratio of paste-to-cabbage is too high and would like more cabbage next time, perhaps I will buy the largest cabbage instead of the smallest. I think the flavor of the paste is a little off, and I would like to try adding some more high-salt ingredients next time, such as soy sauce instead of worcestershire and more broth instead of the pinapple juice.
						</p>
						<p>
							Am I a fool for cooking something I have never made before, going off-recipe, and then criticizing it? Probably, but this won't stop me. I'll do it again and I'll keep doing it after that. I enjoy making things, I enjoy eating things, and I enjoy liking things. Once I finish this jar, I will probably go ahead and make my adjustments and try again. I could say I am doing this for the probiotics, but really it's just fun making something homemade, even if its bad. Plus it's so much cheaper than buying the pre-made stuff. It only takes a solid morning of work to put it all together, and all the ingredients probably cost me less than 5 USD, and I got a full half-gallon jar of the stuff. The little jars of the premade kimchi cost like 7 or 8 USD per and I'm lucky if I get 12 ounces. Saving money like that gives me a devilishly addictive sense of "getting away with it". It was all well worth it, and I look forward to making my next batch.
