						<h2>Installing and Using Arch Linux -- Part 1 of 3</h2>
						<p><i>-- 02 February 2024</i></p>
						<hr>
						<h3>The Decision</h3>
						<p>
							Approximately two months ago I took on the task of transitioning away from Windows as my daily driver to Linux. 
							This was an action motivated by several ongoing factors in my life: A) I have become increasingly fed up with all the bloat 
							and adware that comes installed with Windows, B) I have a deep nostalgia for late-90's/early-00's aesthetic of computers, 
							and I had recently stumbled upon the <a href="https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95">Chicago95</a> Linux theme and I <em>
							needed</em> to get my hands on it, and 3) I wanted to become proficient with Linux for my own professional development.
						</p>
						<p>
							All these factors together made it clear that transitioning to Linux was the right move. 
							So, I was faced with a decision. I could install Linux side-by-side with my exising Windows 10 installation, and I could dual-boot, 
							or I could just completely format everything and start over with Linux.
						</p>
						<p>
							The problem here is that I don't do well with half-measures -- I always slide back into my old habits. This I learned when I tried to delete my facebook 
							and twitter accounts some years ago. At that time, I didn't want to just nuke the entire account and face the grief of losing 
							all my likes and favorites and everything, so I would just delete the app and keep the account for peace of mind... 
							Except I would just end up accessing the account from the web browser anyways and my obsessive, screen-staring habits would continue to proliferate.
						</p>
						<p>
							So I eventually downloaded whatever backups of my data the services offered, deleted the entire account, deleted the app, and was done with it. 
							This strategy woked really well, and I remembered this when I was deciding what to do with my Windows installation. I also asked myself "What 
							functionality will I lose out on by uninstalling Windows entirely?", and the answer I came to was "not much". Windows is still generally the superior platform 
							for gaming on, but I don't have time for gaming these days anyways. Outside of that, I don't really use my PC for much other than surfing the web, 
							writing word documents, and reading emails; all of which I can do easily on a Linux machine.
						</p>
						<p>
							The next question was what distribution of Linux do I want to install? I could always go for one of the big ones like Ubuntu or Fedora, 
							those ones are supported well enough and have sufficient brand-recognition that I even knew about them without even being what I would call 
							a "linux guy". Well, during my research I happened upon one I hadn't heard of before, but it had a cool sounding name that caught my attention: 
							<a href="https://archlinux.org/"><em>Arch-Linux</em></a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							As it turns out, Arch-Linux was exactly what I was looking for. It is essentially a DIY distro. By default, it comes with 
							almost nothing, only the most basic drivers, no desktop environment, no applications. It has the Linux kernel,
							it has a few necessary addons like systemd and it's package manager pacman, and elsewise you basically build it out module-by-module until you have 
							an OS that you're happy with. This appealed to me as it met all my above-stated criteria.
						</p>
						<div style="max-width:75%; text-align:center; margin:auto; border:ridge gold; background-color:darkslateblue">
						<p>
							A)<i>"I have become increasingly fed up with all the bloat and adware that comes installed with Windows,"</i><br><br>
							-- Unike Windows, which has been taking more and more choice away from the user and is constantly throwing things that I don't want in my face at every turn,
							Arch <em>only</em> has what I explicitly install onto it. No more bing news feed popping up in my face whenever my mouse gets too close to the corner of my screen,
							no more cortana search bar, no more bing search widget suddenly appearing in the middle of my desktop, no more demands to set up Windows Hello 
							every time I turn my pc on. Just a simple pc doing what I tell it to and nothing else.
						</p>
						<p>
							B)<i>"I have a deep nostalgia for late-90's/early-00's aesthetic of computers, 
							and I had recently stumbled upon the <a href="https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95">Chicago95</a> Linux theme and I <em>
							needed</em> to get my hands on it"</i><br><br>
							-- As Arch Linux did not come with any specific desktop environment by default, I was free to determine which 
							one I wanted for myself, so I did not have to stress about if Chicago95 would be compatible or not. I could ensure for myself that it would
							work by installing an environment verified to be compatible.
						</p>
						<p> and 3)<i>"I wanted to become proficient with Linux for my own professional development"</i><br><br>
							Well this one was obvious, installing Arch Linux necessitates use of the Linux command line, and as it is so DIY fcused, 
							the community encourages deeply learning the OS and how it works so that you can resolve issues yourself before coming to them for help.
						</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							So by this point, I had pretty well settled on my decisions. 
							I was going to completely wipe Windows from my device, and I would replace it with Arch-Linux.
						</p>
						<p>
							Tune in next time to read about how the installation rpocess went for installing Arch, 
							and how I troubleshooted and solved the issues that arised during the process.<br>
							Later on, in Part 3 I will describe my post-installation customization process and 
							I will comment on my overall thoughts on Arch-Linux and Linux in general.
