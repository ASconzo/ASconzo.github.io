							Currently, I am working on earning my Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. In my course of studies I have developed familiarity with many aspects of information technology and cybersecurity. I understand essential IT and networking concepts such as Windows and Linux operating systems, protocols, network topologies, cloud technologies, programming, scripting, and more. Additionally I have knowledge of essential cybersecurity concepts such as intrusion detection, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, common attacks and exploits, auditing and compliance, risk analysis, and best practices. I also have some hands on experience using platforms such as Kali Linux, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
